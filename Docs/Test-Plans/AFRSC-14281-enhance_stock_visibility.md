5. Test Data and Environment
6. Test Case Definitions and Execution Plan
7. Quality Metrics and Standards
10. Dependencies, Risks and Assumptions
    - need to know why staging is not stable and how to ensure the stability of this
    - need help to be able for test data management alone
    - access to kafka (OMS) and opensearch to get logs, and check messages
